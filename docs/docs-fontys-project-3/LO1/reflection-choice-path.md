## Introduction

After exploring various topics during the orientation workshops, I chose to work on the CodeArchitect MCP project and selected Software Design & Engineering (SDE) as my track for Semester 2. This document reflects on my choice of path, how the project connects to my learning goals, and my motivation for pursuing this direction.

## Why Software Design & Engineering (SDE)?

### Track Alignment

I selected the SDE track because:

1. **System Design Focus**: The track emphasizes designing and building software systems, which directly aligns with my interest in architecture and system design. The CodeArchitect MCP project allows me to work on system design problems while building a tool that helps developers with their own architecture work.

2. **Technical Depth**: SDE provides opportunities to dive deep into technical implementation, optimization, and best practices - all relevant to building a production-quality MCP server.

3. **Developer Tooling**: The track covers building tools that improve developer workflows, which is exactly what CodeArchitect MCP aims to do.

4. **Future Career Goals**: I'm interested in roles involving system architecture, developer experience, and tooling - all areas emphasized in the SDE track.

### Personal Interest in AI

While I chose SDE as my primary track, I also have strong interest in AI and machine learning. The CodeArchitect MCP project bridges these interests:

- Uses AI conversations as the core data source
- Implements tools that enhance AI-assisted development
- Has potential for future AI-powered features (architecture analysis, design suggestions)
- Positions me to potentially choose AI track in Semester 2 or 3

The project allows me to explore AI integration while maintaining a strong focus on system design and engineering practices.

## Why CodeArchitect MCP Project?

### Personal Motivation

This project resonates with me because:

1. **Real Problem**: I've personally experienced losing valuable AI conversations and repeating discussions. Building a solution to my own problem drives motivation.

2. **Learning Opportunity**: Working with MCP protocol, TypeScript, and developer tooling provides valuable learning experiences aligned with my goals.

3. **Open Source Impact**: Creating an open-source tool that others can use and contribute to aligns with my values around community contribution.

4. **Foundation for Future**: This project serves as a foundation for a larger vision (Coarc platform) that could evolve into a comprehensive system design and architecture assistance tool.

### Connection to S1-LO1

This project connects to the Orientation learning outcome by demonstrating:

- **Exploration**: I explored multiple topics, attended workshops, and researched different project directions
- **Informed Choice**: My selection was based on alignment with track, personal interests, and learning goals
- **Track Linking**: Clear connection between project and SDE track themes
- **Personal Development**: Reflection on career interests and future direction

## Project Planning Approach

### Initial Planning Considerations

When planning this project, I considered:

1. **Scope Management**: Keeping scope focused on core features while leaving room for future expansion
2. **Time Constraints**: 5-week timeline requires careful prioritization
3. **Parallel Projects**: Balancing this individual project with Group Project 4
4. **Learning Outcomes**: Ensuring project demonstrates all four S1 learning outcomes

### Key Planning Decisions

1. **Start with MCP Server**: Focus first on the core functionality (session storage/retrieval)
2. **Incremental Development**: Build features incrementally, test thoroughly at each stage
3. **Documentation-Driven**: Keep documentation updated alongside development
4. **User-Centric**: Prioritize developer experience and ease of use

## Learning Goals

### Technical Skills

Through this project, I aim to develop:

- TypeScript and Node.js expertise
- Protocol implementation (MCP SDK)
- File system management and optimization
- Performance optimization techniques
- Test-driven development practices

### Soft Skills

I also aim to improve:

- Project planning and time management
- Technical writing and documentation
- Open-source contribution practices
- User feedback integration
- Self-reflection and continuous improvement

## Connection to Future Semester

### Semester 2 Path Choice

I've chosen Software Design & Engineering for Semester 2 because:

- Aligns with my interest in system architecture
- Provides technical depth in engineering practices
- Opens opportunities for advanced system design work
- Complements potential AI track selection in future semesters

### Long-Term Vision

This project serves as foundation for:

- **Coarc Platform**: Cloud-based version with team collaboration
- **Architecture Tools**: Advanced features for system design assistance
- **Career Development**: Demonstrates skills in developer tooling and system design

## Reflection on Process

### What Worked Well

- Thorough topic exploration in orientation workshops
- Clear problem identification from personal experience
- Alignment between project, track, and interests
- Realistic scope definition

### Challenges Faced

- Choosing between multiple interesting project directions
- Balancing individual project with group project commitments
- Defining scope that's achievable in 5 weeks
- Connecting project to all learning outcomes

### Lessons Learned

- Personal experience with a problem provides strong motivation
- Narrow scope initially allows for deeper focus
- Clear alignment between project and track enhances learning
- Reflection helps clarify goals and direction

## Conclusion

Choosing the CodeArchitect MCP project and the SDE track represents an informed decision based on:
- Alignment with my interests (system design, developer tools, AI)
- Clear connection to track themes
- Personal motivation from experiencing the problem
- Learning opportunities in relevant technologies
- Foundation for future development and career growth

This project allows me to explore software design and engineering practices while building something valuable for the developer community. It connects strongly to S1-LO1 by demonstrating thorough orientation, informed path selection, and clear link to track themes.
