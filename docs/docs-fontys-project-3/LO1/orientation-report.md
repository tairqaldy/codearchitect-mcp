## Introduction

During the orientation period of Project 3, I participated in Software Design & Engineering workshops and consulted with my Semester Coach to make an informed decision about my second semester path choice. This document reflects my orientation activities and the rationale behind my final path selection.

## Workshop Participation

### Software Design & Engineering Workshops

I attended Software Design & Engineering workshops that covered fundamental programming concepts:

- **Introduction to C# Programming**
  - Overview of C# language fundamentals
  - Basic syntax and programming concepts
  - Introduction to object-oriented programming principles

- **Control Flow Basics**
  - While loops fundamentals
  - For loops basics
  - Loop control structures and best practices

These workshops provided me with foundational knowledge in C# programming and control structures, which are essential for the Software Design & Engineering track.

## Path Choice Consultation

### Meeting with Semester Coach Andreea

I had a consultation session with my Semester Coach Andreea regarding my second semester path choice. During this meeting:

- Discussed the available path options for the second semester
- Received guidance on how studies will be structured
- Reviewed the program structure in the Canvas course
- Gained a better understanding of future studies and expectations

### Understanding Program Structure

Through the Canvas course, I was able to:
- Review the detailed program structure for the second semester
- Understand the learning outcomes and expectations
- See how the curriculum is organized
- Gain clarity on the Software Design & Engineering track requirements

## Path Choice Decision

### Final Selection: Software Design & Engineering (SDE)

After participating in the orientation workshops and consulting with my Semester Coach, I made a final decision to choose the **Software Design & Engineering (SDE)** track as my second semester path.

**Rationale for choosing SDE:**

1. **Alignment with Interests**: The SDE track aligns with my interest in system design, architecture, and software engineering principles.

2. **Foundation from Workshops**: The C# programming and control structures workshops confirmed my interest in software development fundamentals.

3. **Clear Understanding**: Through the consultation and Canvas course review, I gained confidence that the SDE track structure matches my learning goals and career aspirations.

4. **Registration**: I have registered for the SDE track in the "progress" platform, confirming my commitment to this path.

## Alignment with Learning Outcomes

### S1-LO1: Orientation

This orientation period demonstrates orientation by:
- **Participating in workshops**: Attended SDE workshops on C# programming and control structures
- **Seeking guidance**: Consulted with Semester Coach Andreea for path choice advice
- **Exploring options**: Reviewed program structure through Canvas course
- **Making informed decision**: Selected SDE track based on workshops, consultation, and program review
- **Taking action**: Registered for SDE track in the "progress" platform

## Next Steps

After completing this orientation period, I will:
1. Begin research activities to identify project ideas (Research Document)
2. Continue with project planning and requirements definition
3. Prepare for the second semester SDE track coursework
